# Oizys
Inspired by projects like Esotope-bfc and Tritium, Oizys is a highly optimizing compiler for brainfuck.
Unlike the previously mentioned projects however, Oizys is not composed of a great amount of adhoc optimizations. Instead a novel algorithm was developed: K6, which is much more general, and can optimize a new class of programs (deep balanced loops).

Oizys is still under developement, and still contains bugs.
